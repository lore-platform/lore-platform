## 🍇 Setting Up Project To Local Machine

**1. Clone the repo to a folder in your local machine by using this command:**

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/lore-platform/lore-platform.git
```

**2. Open the folder in you code editor**

**3. Move into the `.\platform` folder by using this command:**

```cmd
cd .\platform\
```

**4. Install the dependancies by using this command:**

```cmd
npm install
```

This will create the `node_modules` folder, `package-lock.json`, and an updated version of the `package.json` in the `./platform` directory.

**5. After the dependencies are installed, start the development server (the website):**

```cmd
npm run dev
```
