## 🍇 Setting Up Project To Local Machine

**1. Clone the repo to a folder in your local machine by using this command:**

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/lore-platform/lore-platform.git
```

**2. Open the folder in your code editor**

**3. Move into the `.\platform` folder by using this command:**

```cmd
cd .\platform\
```

**4. Install the dependencies by using this command:**

```cmd
npm install
```

This will create the `node_modules` folder, `package-lock.json`, and an updated version of the `package.json` in the `./platform` directory.

**5. After the dependencies are installed, start the development server (the website):**

```cmd
npm run dev
```

## 🧁 Recommended Workflow

### Working On A Specfic Task

If you are working on a task from the Trello board, creating a page/part of a page, or creating a bunch of components - when you are working on new code, follow this workflow please~!

1. Create a new branch from the `main` branch (follow the [Branch Naming Conventions](#branch-naming-conventions) on how to name the new branch)
2. Write your code
3. Commit your code change to your branch locally
4. When you think you are done with your changes, go back to the [project's repo online](https://github.com/lore-platform/lore-platform/tree/main)
5. In the Navigation bar, click 'Pull Requests'
6. Click 'New pull request'
7. Follow the steps in the '[How To Make Pull Requests](#how-to-make-pull-requests)'

### How To Make Pull Requests

Now that you made your changes, you need to make a pull request so that other people can check your work before we can push your changes into the `main` branch and into deployment.

Follow these steps in making a pull request:

1. Go to the [project's repo online](https://github.com/lore-platform/lore-platform/tree/main)
2. Click 'New pull request' on the Pull Requests page
3. Compare changes: the `base` should be **'main'**, and `compare` should be **the name of your branch**
4. Click **'Create Pull Request'**
5. The Title of the Pull Request should be {branch name} - {the title of the task from the Trello board}
   - _For example: LO-0001 - Create the navigation bar component_
6. You do not need to add a description. You can if you want.
7. Look on the right side navigation bar:
   - Assignees: Assign yourself
   - Reviewers: Assign izicodes (Izzy Zennah)
8. Click the 'Create Pull Request' button
9. Wait for Izzy to review you code
   - You might need to make changes if she asks for some
10. After Izzy approves your code, go back to your pull request page
11. Find the 'Merge pull request' button and click the down arrow on the right
12. Click the 'Squash and merge' option
    - This will turn all of your commits into one big commit
13. Click the button again
14. In the popup, make sure the title is correct
15. Leave the description as it is - it is just a list of the commits you made
16. Well done! It has merged with the main branch! Finally, click the 'Delete branch' button.

### Branch Naming Conventions

We need to keep track of the branches that will merge into the `main` branch. Follow these steps:

- The format should be: LO-{branch code}
  - _For example: LO-0001_
- `LO` stands for LORE
- The number is found from the task on the [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/H5r3AFI2/main-development-%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B5-p%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%B5)
- The branch name is given in the task on the [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/H5r3AFI2/main-development-%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B5-p%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%B5)
